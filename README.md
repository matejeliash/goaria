# Goaria

Goaria is a simple server, web UI and runner for aria2c. It is  written with Golang + JS. The app runs as a standalone binary for convenience.
Work in progress.


## Todos

In principle, the app works. The code needs refactoring, and some features still need to be added. Here are a few things I plan to work on in the near future:
- [ ] Maybe split embedded `index.html` into more files
- [ ] Refactor and simplify JS code
- [ ] Show free space in the web UI


## How to run

```
go run main.go
```
or

```
go build
./goaria

```
